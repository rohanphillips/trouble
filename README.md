# Trouble

## Description

The Game Trouble.  If you love this game, here is my attempt to replicate the classic board game on the screen using a Rails API / Javascript implementation.

## Installation

* Rails DB interfaces with POSTGRESQL

## Useage

Open index.html in your favorite browser to play

## Roadmap

This project is a work in progress.  Initially started to meet the requirements for my [Javascript Project](https://github.com/learn-co-students/js-spa-project-instructions-online-web-sp-000/blob/master/README.md "Javascript Project") in my Learn.co bootcamp.
Those reqirements have been met, however the goal is to someday implement the full functionality of the ruleset and display visuals you'd experience while playing the actual board game.
It is anticipated that some form of tests will start to be written for this project to gain experience writing tests for Javascript code
